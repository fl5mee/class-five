    <p class="team-text">In climbing, flow is everything. Moving fluidly from one move to the next until the top, fully immersed in the movement. Dive into the mind of Class Five and La Sportiva climbing athlete Ross Fulkerson as he enters his flow state.<br><br>
      Team Class Five is a competitive rock climbing team and elite training program that prepares athletes for the highest level of competition.
      Established in 2021, founder and head coach Alvaro Rangel has 12+ years of experience as a route setter and climbing coach and has coached for Team USA at adult and youth world championships.
  Over the past two years, the Class Five youth team has won national team banners for performing as one of the top 3 teams in the nation. Small but mighty, and based out of San Diego, CA we believe in dreaming big and trying hard!
